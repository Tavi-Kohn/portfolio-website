## Why

I need a test page to see whether all the formatting and Zola templating is
working as expected. This page is it! All I need here is just a bunch of text
and various markdown constructs.

### Subheading

This heading should show up differently in the table of contents

## Table

| Header A | Header B |
| - | - |
| Cell A0 | Cell B0 |
| Cell A1 | Cell B1 |

## Block Quote

> Block quote test text

## Code Block

```C
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
    return argv->x;
}
```

This is a bit of test text to see how a paragraph looks after a code block,
which I suspect won't quite work as well as I might like.

## Horizontal Rule
